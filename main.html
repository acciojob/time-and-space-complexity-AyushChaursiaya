    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms aim to have better time complexity, ensuring faster execution for larger datasets.

    <p>
        Space complexity, often denoted as O(n), refers to the amount of memory an algorithm takes with respect to the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial to consider, especially when dealing with memory-constrained environments or large-scale data processing tasks.
